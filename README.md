<hr>

Run this project by navigating to Backend Folder after Cloning this Repository with `py app.py` command. <br>
Open a new command prompt to run the frontend. Navigate to folder and use any server of your preference. <br> I usually use Python Server. Command is `py -m http.server`.
> If you are using any system apart from Windows, please use python instead of py.
